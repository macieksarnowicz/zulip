# Printing messages

Zulip [conversations](/help/recent-conversations) are printable from the
Zulip web app. So is any other message feed view, including
[searches](https://zulip.com/help/search-for-messages).

1. Navigate to a stream, topic, or direct message view.

1. Ensure that all messages you wish to print from further back in time
   have been loaded and can be scrolled to on screen (all loaded messages
   will print).

1. Use your browser's print feature (e.g., File > Print) to preview
   and print your messages.

{end_tabs}

Messages will print beginning with the oldest loaded message you can see on
screen. If you need your printout to include messages from further back in time,
you'll need to scroll up through the message history until you can see the
messages you wish to print.

Conversation printouts exclude sidebars and other interface features that you
otherwise see on screen. And whether you're viewing Zulip in the [light or dark
theme](/help/dark-theme), Zulip message views will print with appropriate colors
for paper or system-generated PDFs. Background colors will not be printed.
