# View a message's edit history

Users can view the edit history of any edited or moved message.

Messages with any content edits are labeled **EDITED**, while messages
that have only been [moved to a new
stream](/help/move-content-to-another-stream) or
[topic](/help/move-content-to-another-topic) are labeled **MOVED**.

Organization administrators can
[disable message edit history](/help/disable-message-edit-history).

## View a message's edit history

### Via the main message feed

{start_tabs}

1. Click on the message's **EDITED** or **MOVED** label shown next to
   a user's name or to the left of each message in the message feed.

!!! tip ""

    In organizations where message edit history is disabled, you will
    never see a **MOVED** label; messages that have been moved will be
    marked as **EDITED** just like those whose content has been edited.

!!! keyboard_tip ""

    You can use <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd> to view the edit history of the
    selected message.

{end_tabs}
