# Typing notifications

Zulip displays typing notifications when viewing a direct message or
group direct message conversation to which one of the other
participants is currently composing a message. In the web and desktop apps,
typing notifications are also displayed in the
[all direct messages view](/help/direct-messages#access-all-dms).

Typing notifications are only sent while one is actively editing text in
the compose box. They disappear if typing is paused for several seconds,
if all the content of the message is erased, or if the message is
[saved as a draft](/help/view-and-edit-your-message-drafts#save-a-draft).
Just having the compose box open will not send a typing notification.

### Disable typing notifications

If you'd prefer that others not know whether you're typing, you can
configure Zulip to not send typing notifications.

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|account-and-privacy}

1. Under **Privacy**, toggle **Let recipients see when I'm typing
   direct messages**.
